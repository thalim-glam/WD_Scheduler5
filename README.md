# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Description

This is a "Work day scheduler", the 5th challenge/homework for UC Berkley coding boot camp. 
- The name of this challenge "WDth_Scheduler5" simply reflect my work day scheduler.
- This project helped me to learn more about how jQuery works in JavaScript, how to do dynamic programming and how localstorage works.
 
## Installation

To run the application successfully, we need Microsoft Visual Studio as an editor, Git Bash to clone the github repo and Chrome Dev Tools to inspect the code.

## Task 

-	HTML and CSS is used to design the interface.
-	A starter code is being given and we mostly worked on the JavaScript part.
-	This homework emphasized the importance of using JavaScript web APIs to make dynamic changes to an HTML document.
-	Different event listeners and functions were implemented for user convenience.

## Features

In my code I had 1 main branch and crated a few featured branch to test my code and update.
  - I worked on the basic starter code provided from the bootcamp.
  - Added the screenshot and 
  - Used inspect to monitor my code and it's performance.

## How to Contribute

I followed this https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide as my guidelines to how to write a README file.
I also did tutoring session to understand the homework better.
The TAs were very supportive and guided me a lot.
